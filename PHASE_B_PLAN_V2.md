# Phase B: Enhanced Automation Scripts - Implementation Plan V2

## Overview

Phase B adds **automation and helper scripts** to the self-contained solver skill. These scripts make common workflows easier and reduce the amount of code Claude needs to write repeatedly.

**Timeline:** Weeks 3-4 (12-16 hours)
**Status:** üü° Ready After Phase A Complete

---

## Key Changes from Original Plan

### ‚ùå Original Approach
- External scripts that call `./cash` CLI
- Separate from skill bundle

### ‚úÖ New Approach
- Scripts bundled in skill's `scripts/` directory
- Import from `core/` modules
- Claude can execute them directly
- Follows PDF skill pattern (scripts for common operations)

---

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. ‚úÖ Add interactive plan creation wizard
2. ‚úÖ Add feasibility pre-check tool
3. ‚úÖ Add infeasibility diagnostic tool
4. ‚úÖ Add month-to-month rollover automation
5. ‚úÖ Update SKILL.md with script usage examples

### Non-Goals (Deferred to Phase C)
- ‚ùå AI-powered budget optimization
- ‚ùå Financial advice or recommendations
- ‚ùå Scenario comparison and analysis
- ‚ùå Work-life balance scoring

## New Scripts Specification

### 1. scripts/create_plan.py

**Purpose:** Interactive wizard for creating valid plan.json files

**Features:**
- Prompts for all required fields
- Validates inputs in real-time
- Suggests reasonable defaults
- Detects recurring bill/deposit patterns
- Saves to JSON file

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/create_plan.py --output my_plan.json
```

**Implementation:** ~200 lines
- Interactive prompts using `input()`
- Validation with `core.model` classes
- Pattern detection for recurring transactions
- JSON export with nice formatting

**Key Functions:**
```python
def prompt_balance(prompt: str, default: float) -> int:
    """Prompt for dollar amount, convert to cents."""

def prompt_bills() -> List[Bill]:
    """Interactively collect bills with pattern detection."""

def prompt_deposits() -> List[Deposit]:
    """Interactively collect deposits with pattern detection."""

def detect_recurring_pattern(items: List) -> Optional[str]:
    """Detect weekly/biweekly patterns."""

def create_plan_interactive() -> Plan:
    """Main interactive flow."""
```

---

### 2. scripts/analyze_feasibility.py

**Purpose:** Pre-check plan feasibility without running full solver

**Features:**
- Quick math checks (bills vs income + work)
- Rent guard achievability check
- Band feasibility check
- Early-day solvency check
- Recommendations for fixes

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/analyze_feasibility.py plan.json
```

**Output:**
```
Analyzing plan.json...

‚úÖ Basic Feasibility: LIKELY FEASIBLE
   Total bills: $2,500.00
   Total deposits: $2,000.00
   Max work earnings: $3,000.00
   Available: $5,000.00 >= Required: $2,900.00

‚úÖ Rent Guard: ACHIEVABLE
   Need $1,600 before day 30 bills
   Available: $2,500 (deposits + work)

‚ö†Ô∏è  Target Band: TIGHT
   Target: $500 ¬± $25
   This leaves little room for optimization
   Recommendation: Increase band to $50

Overall: Plan is likely feasible but may require many workdays
```

**Implementation:** ~150 lines
- Load plan from JSON
- Perform quick calculations
- No solver needed
- Generate report with recommendations

---

### 3. scripts/explain_infeasible.py

**Purpose:** Diagnose why a plan is infeasible

**Features:**
- Binary search to find minimal infeasible subset
- Identify which constraints are violated
- Suggest specific fixes
- Show "what-if" scenarios

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/explain_infeasible.py plan.json
```

**Output:**
```
Diagnosing infeasible plan...

‚ùå Plan is INFEASIBLE

Root cause: Insufficient funds
   Total bills: $3,500.00
   Total deposits: $1,000.00
   Max possible work: $3,000.00 (30 days √ó $100)
   Shortfall: $500.00

Possible fixes:
1. Add $500 to start_balance
2. Add a deposit of $500 (any day)
3. Reduce bills by $500 total
4. Lower target_end by $500

Testing fix #2 (add $500 deposit on day 15)...
‚úÖ With this fix, plan becomes FEASIBLE
```

**Implementation:** ~250 lines
- Try removing constraints one by one
- Binary search for minimal fix
- Generate concrete suggestions
- Test suggestions to verify

---

### 4. scripts/rollover_month.py

**Purpose:** Auto-generate next month's plan from current month's solution

**Features:**
- Use current month's final balance as next month's start
- Copy recurring bills/deposits (with date shift)
- Preserve rent guard and band settings
- Optional manual override for one-time changes

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/rollover_month.py \
    --current-plan october.json \
    --current-schedule october_solution.json \
    --output november.json
```

**Output:**
```
Rolling over October ‚Üí November...

From October solution:
   Final balance: $485.27
   ‚Üí November start_balance: $485.27

Recurring bills detected (shifted +30 days):
   ‚úì Rent: Day 30 ‚Üí Day 30 (always end of month)
   ‚úì Phone: Day 5 ‚Üí Day 5
   ‚úì Groceries: Days 7, 14, 21, 28 ‚Üí Days 7, 14, 21, 28

Recurring deposits detected (shift pattern):
   ‚úì Biweekly paycheck pattern detected
   ‚úì Day 10, 24 ‚Üí Day 9, 23 (adjusted for month length)

Created: november.json
```

**Implementation:** ~180 lines
- Load current plan and solution
- Detect recurring patterns
- Shift dates appropriately
- Handle month-length differences (28/30/31 days)
- Generate new plan JSON

---

### 5. scripts/compare_solvers.py

**Purpose:** Benchmark DP vs CP-SAT on plans

**Features:**
- Run both solvers on same plan
- Compare objectives (should match)
- Show timing difference
- Detailed diagnostics
- Optional: run on all example plans

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/compare_solvers.py plan.json
python scripts/compare_solvers.py --all-examples
```

**Output:**
```
Comparing solvers on plan.json...

DP Solver:
   ‚úÖ Objective: (12, 0, 48.47)
   ‚è±Ô∏è  Time: 23ms
   üìä States explored: 15,432

CP-SAT Solver:
   ‚úÖ Objective: (12, 0, 48.47)
   ‚è±Ô∏è  Time: 156ms
   üìä Constraints: 2,847
   üìä Variables: 930

Verification: ‚úÖ Both solvers agree!
Performance: DP is 6.8√ó faster
```

**Implementation:** ~120 lines
- Import both solvers
- Time execution
- Compare results
- Display diagnostics
- Handle missing OR-Tools gracefully

## Updated SKILL.md Sections

### New Section: "Automation Scripts"

```markdown
## Automation Scripts

The skill includes helper scripts for common workflows:

### Create a Plan Interactively

```bash
python scripts/create_plan.py --output my_plan.json
```

Walks you through creating a valid plan with prompts for each field.

### Check Feasibility Before Solving

```bash
python scripts/analyze_feasibility.py my_plan.json
```

Quickly checks if a plan is likely feasible without running the full solver.

### Diagnose Infeasible Plans

```bash
python scripts/explain_infeasible.py my_plan.json
```

Explains why a plan is infeasible and suggests specific fixes.

### Roll Over to Next Month

```bash
python scripts/rollover_month.py \
    --current-plan october.json \
    --current-schedule october_solution.json \
    --output november.json
```

Auto-generates next month's plan from current month's results.

### Compare Solver Performance

```bash
python scripts/compare_solvers.py my_plan.json
```

Benchmarks DP vs CP-SAT solvers and verifies they agree.

For detailed script documentation, see [references/automation_guide.md](references/automation_guide.md).
```
