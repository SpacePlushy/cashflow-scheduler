# UX Improvements - Default Schedule Support

## Issue Identified

When the user asked "Can you make a default schedule?", Claude had to:
1. Write a custom script from scratch
2. Try 3 different parameter combinations before finding feasible ones
3. Show all trial-and-error debugging to the user (verbose, confusing)

**Root Cause:** No built-in quick-start default or clear "hello world" example in SKILL.md

---

## Improvements Made

### 1. Added "Quick Default Schedule" Section to SKILL.md ✅

**Location:** Right at the top of "Quick Start" (most visible)

**Content:**
- Copy-pastable code snippet that creates a feasible default plan
- Shows immediate results (2 workdays schedule)
- Includes reference to helper script
- Emphasizes iterative workflow ("Then customize it!")

**Example output:**
```
✅ Schedule created!
Workdays: 2
Schedule: Spark O Spark O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Work on days: [1, 3]
```

### 2. Created `examples/create_default.py` Helper Script ✅

**Purpose:** One-command default schedule generation

**Features:**
- Creates a realistic, always-feasible default plan
- Displays schedule in multiple formats (calendar, ledger)
- Shows 5 common adjustment examples:
  1. Want to work less? → Increase band tolerance
  2. Want to work more? → Increase target end
  3. Need specific days off? → Lock actions
  4. Add a bill? → Append to bills list
  5. One-time expense? → Use manual adjustments

**Usage:**
```bash
python examples/create_default.py
```

**Output:**
- 60-line formatted output showing the schedule
- Calendar view (10 days per row)
- Sample ledger (first 5 days + last day)
- Adjustment examples for iterative refinement

### 3. Added "Workflow 5: Iterative Adjustments" Section ✅

**Location:** After example workflows in SKILL.md

**Content:**
- Demonstrates the iterative workflow pattern:
  1. Generate initial schedule
  2. User requests change
  3. Adjust parameters
  4. Re-solve
  5. Repeat
- Code examples for 5 common adjustment patterns
- Emphasizes that the skill is designed for back-and-forth refinement

**Example:**
```python
# User: "Can you make me work less?"
plan.band_cents = to_cents(150.0)  # Was 100.0
schedule = solve(plan)

# User: "What if I move my internet bill?"
plan.bills[2] = Bill(day=15, name="Internet", amount_cents=...)
schedule = solve(plan)

# User: "I need days 6-8 off"
plan.actions[5:8] = ["O", "O", "O"]
schedule = solve(plan)
```

## Default Plan Parameters

Created a **realistic, always-feasible default plan**:

```python
Plan(
    start_balance_cents=to_cents(100.00),    # Starting cash
    target_end_cents=to_cents(100.00),        # Target balance
    band_cents=to_cents(100.0),               # Wide tolerance: [$0, $200]
    rent_guard_cents=to_cents(1636.0),        # Pre-rent requirement
    deposits=[
        Deposit(day=10, amount_cents=to_cents(1021.0)),
        Deposit(day=24, amount_cents=to_cents(1021.0))
    ],
    bills=[
        Bill(day=1, name="Auto Insurance", amount_cents=to_cents(108.0)),
        Bill(day=5, name="Groceries", amount_cents=to_cents(150.0)),
        Bill(day=15, name="Groceries", amount_cents=to_cents(150.0)),
        Bill(day=25, name="Groceries", amount_cents=to_cents(150.0)),
        Bill(day=30, name="Rent", amount_cents=to_cents(1636.0))
    ],
    ...
)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Total income: $100 (start) + $2042 (deposits) = $2142
- Total bills: $2194
- Gap: $52 (requires minimal work)
- Wide band ($100) gives solver flexibility
- Result: Only 2 workdays needed (days 1 and 3)

## Testing Results

### Test 1: SKILL.md Snippet
```bash
python test_default_snippet.py

✅ Schedule created!
Workdays: 2
Schedule: Spark O Spark O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Work on days: [1, 3]
```

### Test 2: Helper Script
```bash
python examples/create_default.py

✅ DEFAULT SCHEDULE CREATED
Objective:
  Workdays: 2
  Back-to-back pairs: 0
  Distance from target: $48.00
  Final balance: $148.00

[... full formatted output with calendar, ledger, and adjustment examples ...]
```

### Test 3: Package Integrity
```bash
# Extract and run from packaged zip
unzip cashflow-scheduler.zip
cd cashflow-scheduler
python examples/create_default.py

✅ Works perfectly from packaged version
```

## Expected User Experience (After Fix)

**User:** "Hey Claude—I just added the cashflow-scheduler skill. Can you please use it to make a default schedule?"

**Claude (New):**
```python
# Uses the Quick Default snippet from SKILL.md
from core import solve, Plan, Bill, Deposit, to_cents, cents_to_str

# [Creates default plan with the documented parameters]
plan = Plan(...)

schedule = solve(plan)

# Shows results immediately
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Schedule created!
Workdays: 2
Work on days: [1, 3]

This schedule:
- Works only 2 days out of 30
- Maintains positive balances throughout
- Ends with $148 (within target range)
- Has enough to pay rent ($1636) on day 30

Would you like to adjust anything? I can:
- Reduce workdays (increase band tolerance)
- Change which days you work (lock specific days)
- Add/remove bills
- Adjust the target balance
```

**Much Better:** Clean, fast, single attempt with immediate success!

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (3 attempts, verbose debugging)
```
User: Make a default schedule
Claude: [Creates script, tries parameters, fails]
Claude: [Adjusts parameters, tries again, fails]
Claude: [Copies from simple_plan.json, success]

Result: 3 attempts, confusing output, took 20+ seconds
```

### After (1 attempt, clean output)
```
User: Make a default schedule
Claude: [Uses SKILL.md snippet, success immediately]

Result: 1 attempt, clean output, < 5 seconds
```

## Deployment Status

✅ **All improvements tested and working**
✅ **Package updated and validated**
✅ **Ready for upload**

The skill now provides a **frictionless default schedule experience** while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Next Steps

1. **Upload the updated package:** `cashflow-scheduler.zip`
2. **Test in Claude:** Ask "make a default schedule" and verify it works smoothly
3. **Test iterative adjustments:** Ask for changes (fewer workdays, move bills, etc.)
4. **User feedback:** Gather real-world usage patterns

The skill is now optimized for the primary use case: **quick default generation with iterative refinement**.
