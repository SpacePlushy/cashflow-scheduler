"""
CP-SAT verification and tie-enumeration engine.

This module builds a constraint programming model in OR-Tools CP-SAT that
captures the same feasibility rules and objective used by the DP solver. It is
used to:

- Solve a sequential lexicographic objective (workdays, back-to-back work,
  |final diff|, number of large days, and a final single-day penalty) and
  extract an optimal 30-day schedule.
- Cross-check a DP-produced schedule for lexicographic optimality.
- Enumerate alternative schedules ("ties") that achieve the exact same
  lexicographic objective value.

Key ideas:
- One-hot action variable per day over ACTIONS = ("O","S","M","L","SS").
- Derived boolean indicators for off/work, back-to-back work pairs, and
  off-off pairs in adjacent days.
- Integer prefix balance recursion over net cents deltas per action.
- Feasibility constraints mirror validator rules: non-negative daily closings,
  Day-1 Large, Day-30 pre-rent guard, final band, and an Off-Off window rule.
- Sequential lexicographic optimization modeled by solving 5 stages in order
  and fixing the previous objective part to its optimum before proceeding.
