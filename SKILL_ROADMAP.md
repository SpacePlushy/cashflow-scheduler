# Cashflow Scheduler Skill - Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the three-phase development of a Claude Code skill for the cashflow scheduler project. The skill will teach Claude how to use the cashflow scheduling system effectively, progressing from basic tool usage to advanced financial planning capabilities.

## Skill Metadata (Final)

```yaml
name: cashflow-scheduler
description: Financial planning tool for optimizing 30-day work schedules to meet expenses while minimizing workdays. Use when creating cashflow plans, analyzing bill payment schedules, troubleshooting infeasible plans, or understanding solver algorithms (DP vs CP-SAT). Helps balance income from gig work against monthly bills and target savings.
```

## Three-Phase Approach

### Phase A: Minimal Tool-Use Skill ⚡ (Immediate - Week 1)
**Goal:** Enable Claude to effectively use the existing `cash` CLI tool

**Focus:** Documentation-centric approach leveraging existing tools

**Deliverables:**
- SKILL.md with CLI usage patterns
- Plan schema reference documentation
- 3-4 example plans demonstrating common scenarios
- Troubleshooting guide for common errors

**Why Start Here:**
- Fastest implementation (mostly documentation)
- Leverages battle-tested existing code
- Provides immediate value
- Foundation for future enhancements
- Follows "minimal viable skill" principle

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### Phase B: Enhanced Workflow Skill 🔧 (Near-term - Weeks 2-3)
**Goal:** Add interactive helper scripts for common operations

**Focus:** Automation and improved developer experience

**New Components:**
- Interactive plan creation wizard
- Feasibility analyzer
- Diagnostic tools for infeasible plans
- Month-to-month rollover automation
- Solver comparison utilities

**Why Second:**
- Builds on Phase A foundation
- Addresses pain points discovered during Phase A usage
- Provides productivity improvements
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Estimated Effort:** 12-16 hours

---

### Phase C: Financial Planning Skill 💰 (Long-term - Weeks 4-6)
**Goal:** Comprehensive financial advice system

**Focus:** Strategic financial planning guidance

**New Capabilities:**
- Budget optimization strategies
- Bill payment timing recommendations
- Work-life balance considerations
- Savings goal planning
- Scenario analysis and "what-if" modeling
- Financial health metrics

**Why Last:**
- Requires domain expertise in financial planning
- Most complex to implement correctly
- Benefits from learnings from Phases A and B
- Highest value but requires solid foundation

**Estimated Effort:** 20-30 hours

## Risk Management

### Phase A Risks
- **Risk:** Documentation becomes outdated as code changes
- **Mitigation:** Keep docs in sync with code, use version references

### Phase B Risks
- **Risk:** Scripts duplicate existing functionality
- **Mitigation:** Survey existing tools first, reuse where possible
- **Risk:** Scripts become maintenance burden
- **Mitigation:** Keep scripts simple, well-tested, documented

### Phase C Risks
- **Risk:** Financial advice is incorrect or misleading
- **Mitigation:** Extensive testing, conservative recommendations, clear disclaimers
- **Risk:** Scope creep (becoming full financial planning system)
- **Mitigation:** Define clear boundaries, focus on cashflow-specific advice

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Claude Code skills framework
- Existing cashflow scheduler codebase
- Python 3.10+ with virtual environment
- OR-Tools (optional, for CP-SAT)

### Internal Dependencies
- Phase B depends on Phase A completion
- Phase C depends on Phase B stabilization
- Each phase builds on previous phase learnings

---

## Iteration Strategy

### Within Each Phase
1. **Design** - Create detailed plan
2. **Implement** - Build minimal version
3. **Test** - Use on real scenarios
4. **Iterate** - Refine based on usage
5. **Document** - Update based on learnings
6. **Package** - Create distributable skill

### Between Phases
1. **Review** - Assess previous phase effectiveness
2. **Identify** - Find pain points and gaps
3. **Plan** - Design next phase to address findings
4. **Validate** - Ensure new features add value
5. **Implement** - Build next phase
