# Final Update - Using Real plan.json as Default

## Summary

Updated the default schedule to use the **actual plan.json from the repository** instead of a simplified version. This provides a realistic, real-world example with 25 bills covering all monthly expenses.

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Change:** Default parameters now match plan.json exactly

---

## What Changed

### Before (Simplified Default)
- Start: $100.00
- Bills: 5 (insurance + groceries + rent)
- Result: **2 workdays**
- Unrealistic simplification

### After (Real plan.json)
- Start: **$90.50** (actual starting balance)
- Bills: **25 bills** (all monthly expenses)
- Result: **12 workdays** (realistic for covering ~$3,331 in bills)
- Real-world scenario

## Default Schedule Details

**Financial Overview:**
```
Starting Balance:  $90.50
Deposits:          $2,042.00 (2 paychecks)
Total Income:      $2,132.50

Bills Total:       $3,330.97
  - Auto Insurance: $108.00
  - YouTube Premium: $8.00
  - Groceries (4x): $450.00
  - Weed (4x): $80.00
  - Electric: $139.00
  - Streaming: $242.00
  - AI Subscription: $220.00
  - Cat Food (4x): $160.00
  - Cell Phone: $177.00
  - AppleCare: $30.47
  - Ring: $10.00
  - Internet: $30.00
  - Rent: $1,636.00

Gap to Cover:      $1,198.47
Work Required:     12 days @ $100/day = $1,200
```

**Optimal Schedule:**
```
Workdays: 12
Back-to-back pairs: 0 (maximally spread out)
Final balance: $42.03 (within target $90.50 Â± $100)

Work on days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30

Pattern:
Days 1-13:  Alternating work/off (Spark-O-Spark-O...)
Days 14-21: All off (8-day rest period)
Days 22-30: Alternating work/off (Spark-O-Spark-O...)
```

**Why This Schedule is Optimal:**
- Minimizes total workdays (12 is minimum to cover bills)
- Zero back-to-back work pairs (maximum rest between shifts)
- Includes 8-day continuous rest period (days 14-21)
- Maintains positive balance throughout
- Ends within target band ($42.03 is within $90.50 Â± $100)

## Files Updated

### 1. SKILL.md
**Section:** Quick Start â†’ Generate a Default Schedule

**Before:**
```python
bills=[
    Bill(day=1, name="Auto Insurance", amount_cents=to_cents(108.0)),
    Bill(day=5, name="Groceries", amount_cents=to_cents(150.0)),
    Bill(day=15, name="Groceries", amount_cents=to_cents(150.0)),
    Bill(day=25, name="Groceries", amount_cents=to_cents(150.0)),
    Bill(day=30, name="Rent", amount_cents=to_cents(1636.0))
]
# Result: 2 workdays
```

**After:**
```python
bills=[
    Bill(day=1, name="Auto Insurance", amount_cents=to_cents(108.0)),
    Bill(day=2, name="YouTube Premium", amount_cents=to_cents(8.0)),
    # ... all 25 bills from plan.json ...
    Bill(day=30, name="Rent", amount_cents=to_cents(1636.0))
]
# Result: 12 workdays (realistic)
```

### 2. examples/create_default.py
**Function:** `create_default_plan()`

## Expected User Experience

**User:** "Make a default schedule"

**Claude:** *(Uses SKILL.md snippet, works immediately)*
```
âœ… Schedule created!

Your optimal schedule:
