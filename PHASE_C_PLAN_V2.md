## New Intelligence Modules

### 1. intelligence/budget_optimizer.py

**Purpose:** Find optimal budget parameters for goals

**Features:**
- Suggest optimal target_end based on deposits/bills
- Calculate minimum rent_guard needed
- Recommend band width
- Optimize for minimum workdays

**Usage:**
```python
from intelligence import optimize_budget

plan = load_plan("rough_draft.json")

# Get optimization recommendations
recommendations = optimize_budget(
    plan,
    goal="minimize_work",  # or "maximize_savings"
    constraints={"min_workdays": 10, "max_workdays": 20}
)

print(f"Recommended target_end: ${recommendations.target_end/100:.2f}")
print(f"Recommended band: ${recommendations.band/100:.2f}")
print(f"Expected workdays: {recommendations.workdays}")
```

**Implementation:** ~300 lines
- Try different parameter combinations
- Use solver to evaluate each
- Find Pareto-optimal solutions
- Generate ranked recommendations

**Output:**
```
Budget Optimization Results:

Goal: Minimize workdays

Current plan: 15 workdays required

Optimized recommendations:
1. 🥇 12 workdays - Lower target to $450, band $75
   Saves 3 workdays, still builds savings

2. 🥈 13 workdays - Lower target to $475, band $50
   Saves 2 workdays, tighter budget

3. 🥉 14 workdays - Keep target $500, increase band to $100
   Saves 1 workday, more flexibility

Current parameters already near-optimal for your goals.
```

---

### 2. intelligence/scenario_analyzer.py

**Purpose:** Compare multiple scenarios side-by-side

**Features:**
- Compare different deposit schedules
- Compare different bill amounts
- Show impact of one-time expenses
- Sensitivity analysis

**Usage:**
```python
from intelligence import compare_scenarios

base_plan = load_plan("base.json")

# Define scenarios
scenarios = {
    "Current": base_plan,
    "Extra Shift": modify_plan(base_plan, extra_work_allowed=True),
    "Delay Bill": modify_plan(base_plan, move_bill=(5, 15)),
    "Higher Rent Guard": modify_plan(base_plan, rent_guard=2000)
}

comparison = compare_scenarios(scenarios)
print_comparison_table(comparison)
```

**Output:**
```
Scenario Comparison:

                    Current  Extra Shift  Delay Bill  Higher Guard
Feasible?           ✅       ✅           ✅          ❌
Workdays            12       12           11          -
Back-to-back        0        2            0           -
Final Balance       $485     $485         $485        -
Min Daily Balance   $15      $15          $25         -
Stress Score        6.5/10   7.5/10       5.5/10      -

Recommendation: "Delay Bill" scenario offers best balance
- Same final outcome
- One fewer workday
- Higher minimum balance (less stressful)
- No back-to-back work required
```

**Implementation:** ~250 lines
- Solve each scenario
- Extract metrics
- Compare side-by-side
- Generate recommendations

---

### 3. intelligence/health_scorer.py

**Purpose:** Score financial health of a plan/schedule

**Features:**
- Cash flow volatility score
- Buffer adequacy score
- Work distribution score
- Overall financial health rating

**Usage:**
```python
from intelligence import score_health

plan = load_plan("october.json")
schedule = solve(plan)

health = score_health(plan, schedule)

print(f"Overall Health: {health.overall_score}/100")
print(f"  Cash Flow Stability: {health.stability_score}/100")
print(f"  Buffer Adequacy: {health.buffer_score}/100")
print(f"  Work Distribution: {health.distribution_score}/100")
print(f"  Stress Level: {health.stress_score}/100")
```

**Scoring Algorithm:**

1. **Cash Flow Stability (0-100)**
   - Variance in daily balances
   - Minimum balance headroom
   - Frequency of near-zero days
   - Formula: `100 - (volatility_penalty + near_zero_penalty)`

2. **Buffer Adequacy (0-100)**
   - Rent guard margin
   - Band utilization
   - Emergency cushion
   - Formula: `min(100, (actual_buffer / ideal_buffer) * 100)`

3. **Work Distribution (0-100)**
   - Work clustering (b2b penalty)
   - Rest day distribution
   - Work intensity
   - Formula: `100 - (clustering_penalty + intensity_penalty)`

4. **Overall Score (0-100)**
   - Weighted average of above
   - Weights: Stability 40%, Buffer 30%, Distribution 30%

**Output:**
```
Financial Health Report for October

Overall Score: 78/100 (Good)

📊 Breakdown:
   Cash Flow Stability: 85/100 (Very Good)
   ✓ Low variance in daily balances
   ✓ Minimum balance stays above $50
   ⚠️  3 days with balance under $100

   Buffer Adequacy: 72/100 (Acceptable)
   ✓ Rent guard margin: $150 above minimum
   ⚠️  Band utilization: 85% (tight)
   ⚠️  Emergency cushion: $0 (improve this)

   Work Distribution: 75/100 (Good)
   ✓ No back-to-back work days
   ✓ Even distribution across month
   ⚠️  12 workdays is moderate intensity

🎯 Improvement Suggestions:
   1. Increase band from $25 to $50 (buffer +10 points)
   2. Build $200 emergency cushion (buffer +15 points)
   3. Reduce to 11 workdays if possible (distribution +5 points)
```

**Implementation:** ~350 lines

---

### 4. intelligence/balance_optimizer.py

**Purpose:** Optimize work-life balance

**Features:**
- Minimize workdays while meeting goals
- Maximize consecutive rest days
- Avoid weekend work (if specified)
- Cluster vs distribute work trade-offs

**Usage:**
```python
from intelligence import optimize_balance

plan = load_plan("plan.json")

# Find schedule that maximizes rest
balanced = optimize_balance(
    plan,
    priorities={
        "minimize_workdays": 1.0,
        "avoid_back_to_back": 0.8,
        "prefer_weekends_off": 0.6
    }
)

print(f"Work-Life Score: {balanced.balance_score}/100")
print(f"Workdays: {balanced.workdays}")
print(f"Longest rest period: {balanced.longest_rest} days")
print(f"Weekend work: {balanced.weekend_work_count} days")
```

**Output:**
```
Work-Life Balance Optimization

Current schedule: 12 workdays, balance score 65/100

Optimized schedule: 12 workdays, balance score 82/100

Improvements:
✓ Same total workdays
✓ Eliminated all back-to-back work
✓ Created two 5-day rest periods
✓ No weekend work (where possible)

Schedule pattern:
Week 1: Spark, O, O, Spark, O, O, O
Week 2: Spark, O, Spark, O, O, Spark, O
Week 3: O, Spark, O, O, Spark, O, O
Week 4: Spark, O, Spark, O, Spark, Spark

Trade-offs:
⚠️  Two Spark days at month-end (unavoidable due to rent)
✓  Otherwise excellent work distribution
```

**Implementation:** ~280 lines

### 5. intelligence/predictor.py

**Purpose:** Predict future cash flow needs

**Features:**
- Trend analysis from historical plans
- Predict next month's needs
- Identify seasonal patterns
- Risk assessment

**Usage:**
```python
from intelligence import predict_next_month

history = [
    load_plan("july.json"),
    load_plan("august.json"),
    load_plan("september.json")
]

prediction = predict_next_month(history)

print(f"Predicted start balance: ${prediction.start_balance/100:.2f}")
print(f"Predicted bills total: ${prediction.bills_total/100:.2f}")
print(f"Predicted deposits total: ${prediction.deposits_total/100:.2f}")
print(f"Recommended workdays: {prediction.recommended_workdays}")
```

**Output:**
```
Cash Flow Prediction for November

Based on 3-month history (Aug-Oct):

📈 Trends Detected:
   Start Balance: Decreasing (-$50/month)
   Bills: Stable (~$2,500/month)
   Deposits: Increasing (+$100/month)

🔮 November Predictions:
   Expected Start: $435 (Oct ending avg: $485 - trend)
   Expected Bills: $2,500 (± $150)
   Expected Deposits: $2,100 (+ $100 from trend)
   Recommended Workdays: 11-13

⚠️  Risk Factors:
   - Start balance trending down
   - Consider one-time income boost
   - Watch for unexpected expenses

💡 Recommendations:
   1. Plan for 12 workdays (middle of range)
   2. Set band to $75 (higher due to volatility)
   3. Consider rent guard $1,700 (+$100 buffer)
```

**Implementation:** ~300 lines
