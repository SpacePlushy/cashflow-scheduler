### Test 5: Infeasible Plan Handling ✅

**Test:** Created plan with impossible constraints

**Scenario:**
```
Start: $100
Bills: $10,000 (Day 1)
Max possible income: $100 + (30 × $100) = $3,100
```

**Expected:** RuntimeError with clear message

RuntimeError: No feasible schedule found under constraints and band
```

**Verdict:** ✅ Infeasible plans correctly detected with clear errors

---

### Test 6: Validation System ✅

**Test 6a: Day 1 Not Spark**

Created invalid schedule with Day 1 = "O" instead of "Spark"

**Result:**
```
✅ Validation correctly caught Day 1 not being Spark
Check failed: Day 1 Spark: O
```

**Verdict:** ✅ Validation catches Day 1 violations

---

### Test 7: Import Integrity ✅

**Tested Imports:**
```python
from core import (
    solve, Plan, Schedule, Bill, Deposit, Adjustment, DayLedger,
    to_cents, cents_to_str, build_ledger, validate, ValidationReport,
    SHIFT_NET_CENTS, dp_solver, cpsat_solver
)

from core.dp_solver import solve as dp_solve
from core.cpsat_solver import solve as cpsat_solve
from core.model import build_prefix_arrays, pre_rent_base_on_day30
from core.ledger import build_ledger
from core.validate import validate
```

**Result:** ✅ All imports successful, no circular dependencies

**Verdict:** ✅ Import system working correctly

---

### Test 8: Edge Cases ✅

**Test 8a: Locked Actions**

Locked first 6 days: `["Spark", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O"] + [None] * 24`

**Result:**
```
✅ Locked actions honored
First 6 days: Spark O O O O O
```

**Test 8b: Manual Adjustments**

Compared plans with/without $200 adjustment on Day 15

**Result:**
```
✅ Manual adjustment reduced required workdays
Without adjustment: 5 workdays
With +$200 adjustment: 3 workdays
```

**Test 8c: Money Conversion**

Tested 5 conversion scenarios:
- `to_cents(100.00)` → 10000 ✅
- `to_cents(0.50)` → 50 ✅
- `to_cents(123.45)` → 12345 ✅
- `to_cents(-50.00)` → -5000 ✅
- `cents_to_str(10050)` → "100.50" ✅

**Test 8d: Band Tolerance**

Compared tight vs wide band:
- Tight band (±$1): 4 workdays
- Wide band (±$200): 2 workdays

**Verdict:** ✅ All edge cases handled correctly

---

### Test 9: Solver Fallback ✅

**Tested:**
1. DP solver directly
2. CP-SAT with fallback enabled
3. Auto solver selection

**Results:**
```
✅ DP solver works: (1, 0, 0)
✅ CP-SAT with fallback works: solver=cpsat, obj=(1, 0, 0)
✅ Auto solver works: (1, 0, 0)
```

**Findings:**
- DP solver always available

## Known Issues

### None Critical

No critical issues found during testing.

### Minor Notes

1. **Example Scripts Path Handling:** Scripts use `sys.path.insert()` to work standalone. This is fine for skill usage but noted for reference.

2. **OR-Tools Platform:** OR-Tools may not be available on all platforms, but graceful DP fallback ensures skill always works.

3. **Interactive Creator:** Not tested automatically (requires user input). Manual testing recommended.

---

## Security Assessment

### Code Review

- ✅ No external network calls
- ✅ No file system writes (except test scripts)
- ✅ No eval() or exec() usage
- ✅ No arbitrary code execution
- ✅ Input validation present (JSON parsing, data types)

### Safe for Deployment

The skill is safe to deploy and use in production environments.

## Recommendations

### Before Deployment

1. ✅ **All automated tests pass** - Complete
2. ⏳ **Manual test interactive creator** - Recommended
